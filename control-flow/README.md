## `if/else` expressions

We can create conditional branches in the execution of our code by using the `if` and `else` keywords, similar to what other languages do.

The form of an `if` expression is a condition expression followed by a consequent block, any number of `else if` conditions and blocks, and an optional trailing `else` block. The condition expressions must have type `bool`.

```rust
if 1 == 2 {
    println!("whoops, mathematics broke");
} else {
    println!("everything's fine!");
}
```

In the preceding example, the condition of `if` is the expression `1 == 2`, which evaluates into a boolean type with the value `false`.

You can have multiple conditions by combining if and else in an else if expression. For example:

```rust
let number = 6;

if number % 4 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 4");
} else if number % 3 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 3");
} else if number % 2 == 0 {
    println!("number is divisible by 2");
} else {
    println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
}
```

This program has four possible paths it can take. After running it, you should see the following output:

```
    number is divisible by 3
```

If a condition expression evaluates to `true`, the consequent block is executed. Any subsequent `else if` or else `block` is skipped. If a condition expression evaluates to `false`, the consequent block is skipped. Any subsequent `else if` condition is evaluated. If all `if` and `else if` conditions evaluate to `false`, then any `else` block is executed.

Unlike in most languages, `if` blocks can also act as expressions. Remember that all branches must return the same type for our code to compile.

```rust
let formal = true;
let greeting = if formal {
    "Good evening."
} else {
    "Hello, friend!"
};
println!(greeting) // prints "Good evening."
```

In the preceding example, we can see that the result of the `if` expression is stored in the `greeting` variable.

## Loop forever with `loop`

A `loop` expression denotes an infinite loop. It repeats execution of its body continuously:

```rust
loop {
    println!("I loop forever");
}
```
Unlike the other kinds of loops in Rust like while and for, `loop` can be used in expressions that return values via `break`.

```rust
let mut i = 1;
let something = loop {
    i *= 2;
    if i > 100 {
        break i;
    }
};
assert_eq!(something, 128);
```

Every `break` a loop has must have the same type. When it's not explicitly giving something, `break;` returns `()` (an empty tuple).

## Loop until a criteria is met with `while` loops

A `while` expression loops until a predicate is false.

A `while` loop begins by evaluating the boolean loop conditional expression. If the loop conditional expression evaluates to `true`, the loop body block executes. Control then returns to the loop conditional expression. If the loop conditional expression evaluates to `false`, the `while` expression completes.

The following code loops until the predicate evaluates to `true`:

```rust
let mut counter = 0;

while counter < 10 {
    println!("hello");
    counter = counter + 1;
}
```

## Iterate with `for` loops

A `for` expression extracts values from an iterator. It loops until the iterator is empty.

In Rust, an iterator is any type that can iterate over values. Some values can be iterated over directly and others can produce iterators by calling methods like `.iter()`.

```rust
let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

for element in a.iter() {
    println!("the value is: {}", element);
}
```

The preceding code iterates through each element in the array and binds it to the `element` variable. The `println!` macro then prints each of those values in sequence.

Another easy way to create an iterator is to use the range notation `a..b`. This notation yields values from `a` (inclusive) to `b` (exclusive) in steps of one.

```rust
for item in 0..5 {
    println!("{}", item * 2);
}
```

The preceding code iterates through the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 and binds it to the `item` variable for each cycle of this loop.
